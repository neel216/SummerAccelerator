# Summer Accelerator Scientific Programming Final Project

Summer Accelerator is a week long summer camp hosted by the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics. Scientific Programming was a class taught by a computer science professor at the school that taught a basic understanding of data analytics with Python. For this final project, multiple datasets from high schools in the New York City area were analyzed to try to find a correlation between standardized test scores and Grade Point Average.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the dependences for the project.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the code in the ```main.py``` file to view the findings of the project.

## Contributing

The project is over, but feel free to contact me with tips. Keep in mind this was my first experience with Python.
